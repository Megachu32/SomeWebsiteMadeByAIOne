There are two things i could've added that should've been inside.
1) Being able to apply changes to border cells.
2) Collapseable history as to make it easier to scroll.

I could've prompted again to add those feature but the current version has taken more than 10 tries and so i'm going to take a break for a bit.
See ya in a week if i were to ever post another one ever again.
